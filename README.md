## 🚀 Project Journey & Future

Hello, SA-MP community! 👋

Let's take a quick trip down memory lane and peek into the future of SA-MP RCON:

### 🌱 2020 - The Birth of SA-MP RCON

SA-MP RCON emerged in 2020, blending professional expertise with gaming enthusiasm. Amid my Xamarin.Forms work projects, I envisioned an exciting application - enabling SA-MP servers management from Android devices. This idea perfectly merged my day job skills with my passion for gaming.

### 🔍 Current State

Think of this version as a prototype. It works, but it's built on Xamarin Forms, which is now deprecated and no longer maintained.

### 🎓 Learning Opportunity

For budding developers, this project offers insights into rapid prototyping. I created it quickly, without focusing on architecture or clean code practices. While not a best practices showcase, it demonstrates how ideas can be brought to life swiftly.

### 🔮 Future Dreams

This version no longer receives updates as I'm focused on other projects. However, there are ideas for the future! While there's no set timeline and everything depends on my availability, a potential new version built with .NET MAUI could include:

- 🏗️ Rock-solid architecture
- 🧪 Unit testing
- 🌟 Best coding practices
- 📱 Possible F-Droid publication
- 🖥️ Potential support for iOS, Windows, and Linux

👐 **Open Invitation:** Whether you're here to use the app, learn from it, or dream about its future, you're part of this journey. The code is open for all to see, use, and learn from.

Remember, every big idea starts somewhere. SA-MP RCON began as a quick experiment. Stay tuned, and keep managing those servers like pros! 🎮
